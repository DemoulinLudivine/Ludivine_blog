# Conclusion

In conclusion, human activities have a significant impact on the disappearance of certain animals.
The biggest causes are overfishing, poaching, lawlessness, but also climate causes; forest fire, landslide, ...
But the lies begin to evolve. There are more and more protests and associations for the conservation of endangered species.
Technological advances make it possible to prevent the definitive extinction of certain species. For example, the creation of northern white rhino embryos.
So things are only starting to change, but there is still a long way to go.
